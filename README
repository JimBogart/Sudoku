This is a collection of Java files that allow users to play a Simple Sudoku Game. 

There is also a SudokuSolve program that will return fully solved Sudokus from "easy" Sudoku puzzles. The sudoku solve does not use
a back tracking algorithm, it simple generates possible guesses, and checks to see if they are the only possible values for the row or column.
The program will not solve Sudoku puzzles that require trial and error!
